      <h2>Fake News and Social Media Manipulation</h2>
      
      <div class="media-container">
        <img src="../assets/images/fake-news.jpg" alt="Social media with fake news alerts">
        <p><em>Image: The spread of misinformation on social media platforms</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>In our digital age, we're bombarded with information from countless sources daily. But how much of it can we really trust? Critical thinking skills are essential to navigate this landscape and avoid being manipulated by fake news.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>The Danger of Unverified Information</h3>
      <p>Social media platforms have become breeding grounds for misinformation. A recent study found that false news spreads six times faster than true stories on platforms like Twitter. This is particularly dangerous during elections, health crises, or times of social unrest when manipulated narratives can influence public opinion and even sway election results.</p>
      
     
      
      <h3>Real-World Consequences</h3>
      <p>During the 2020 U.S. elections, false claims about voting fraud led to widespread confusion and even violent protests. Similarly, COVID-19 misinformation caused many people to reject safety measures or pursue dangerous unproven treatments. These examples show how fake news isn't just harmless - it can have life-or-death consequences.</p>
      
      <div class="case-study">
        <h4>Case Study: The "Pizzagate" Conspiracy</h4>
        <p>In 2016, false stories claimed a Washington pizzeria was the center of a child trafficking ring involving high-profile politicians. Despite being completely fabricated, the story went viral and even led to an armed man storming the restaurant. This demonstrates how quickly fake news can spiral out of control with real-world violence.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>How to Spot Fake News</h3>
      <div class="checklist">
        <p><strong>Critical Thinking Checklist:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check the source:</strong> Is it reputable? Does the URL look suspicious?</li>
          <li><strong>Look for evidence:</strong> Are there verifiable facts, data, or expert opinions?</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-reference:</strong> Are other trustworthy outlets reporting the same?</li>
          <li><strong>Examine the date:</strong> Is old news being presented as current?</li>
          <li><strong>Question emotions:</strong> Does the content seem designed to provoke strong reactions?</li>
          <li><strong>Verify images:</strong> Use reverse image search to check if photos are used out of context</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="media-container">
        <img src="../assets/images/fact-check.jpg" alt="Fact checking process">
        <p><em>Image: The fact-checking process in action</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Developing Media Literacy</h3>
      <p>Becoming media literate requires practice. Start by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Following fact-checking organizations like Snopes or FactCheck.org</li>
        <li>Reading news from multiple perspectives</li>
        <li>Understanding common manipulation techniques (cherry-picking, false dilemmas)</li>
        <li>Recognizing your own biases that might make you vulnerable to certain narratives</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>Critical thinking isn't about distrusting all information - it's about developing healthy skepticism. By verifying before sharing, we can all help stop the spread of misinformation and make social media a more reliable space for public discourse.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="case-study">
        <h4>Discussion Question:</h4>
        <p>Can you recall a time when you encountered fake news? How did you realize it was false? What strategies do you currently use to verify information before believing or sharing it? Share your experiences in the comments below.</p>
