      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>Today, we get lots of information every day. But not all of it is true. We need to think carefully about what we read online.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>The Problem with Fake Information</h3>
      <p>Social media often shares wrong information. Studies show false news spreads faster than true news. This is bad during important times like elections or health problems.</p>
      
      <h3>Real Problems from Fake News</h3>
      <p>In 2020, false stories about voting problems in the U.S. made people angry. Wrong COVID-19 information made some people not wear masks or take bad medicines. Fake news can be very dangerous.</p>
      
      <div class="case-study">
        <h4>Example: The "Pizzagate" Story</h4>
        <p>In 2016, people shared a false story about a pizza restaurant. The story said bad things were happening there. It wasn't true, but one man believed it and went there with a gun.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>How to Find Fake News</h3>
      <div class="checklist">
        <p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who wrote it:</strong> Is it from a good website?</li>
          <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Are there facts or numbers?</li>
          <li><strong>Other sources:</strong> Do other good websites say the same?</li>
          <li><strong>Date:</strong> Is it old news?</li>
          <li><strong>Feelings:</strong> Does it make you very angry or scared?</li>
          <li><strong>Pictures:</strong> Use Google to check if photos are real</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="media-container">
        <img src="../assets/images/fact-check.jpg" alt="Fact checking process">
        <p><em>Image: The fact-checking process in action</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Learning About Media</h3>
      <p>To understand media better:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow websites that check facts</li>
        <li>Read news from different places</li>
        <li>Learn how people trick others online</li>
        <li>Know what you like to believe</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>Critical thinking means checking information before you believe it. If we all check before sharing, social media can be better.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="case-study">
        <h4>Question for You:</h4>
        <p>Did you ever see fake news? How did you know it was fake? What do you do to check news? Tell us in the comments.</p>
