      <h2>Corruption Network Uncovered in Colombian Navy</h2>
      
      <div class="media-container">
        <img src="../assets/images/navy-corruption.jpg" alt="Colombian Navy officials under investigation">
        <p><em>Image: Colombian Navy officials involved in the corruption scandal</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>Recent investigations have exposed an alleged corruption network within the Colombian Navy, involving improper contracting processes and possible embezzlement of public funds.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>The Case Details</h3>
      <p>According to reports from Infobae Colombia, authorities have uncovered what appears to be an organized corruption scheme within the Colombian Navy. The investigation suggests that several high-ranking officials manipulated contracting processes for personal gain, with the phrase "we stole the process" allegedly used among those involved.</p>
      
      <p>The scandal came to light through intercepted communications and financial audits that revealed irregular patterns in military contracts. Prosecutors estimate that millions of dollars may have been diverted from legitimate defense budgets into private accounts.</p>
      
      
      
      <h3>Justice System Response</h3>
      <p>Colombian authorities have already arrested several suspects, including active and retired naval officers. The case is being handled by the Specialized Directorate against Corruption, with charges expected to include embezzlement, illicit enrichment, and criminal conspiracy.</p>
      
      <p>This case represents one of the most significant corruption scandals in recent Colombian military history and has prompted calls for deeper reforms in defense sector procurement processes.</p>
      
      <div class="discussion-question">
        <h3>Punishment vs. Rehabilitation: A Critical Debate</h3>
        <p>Cases like this raise important questions about how justice systems should handle white-collar crimes and corruption offenses. Some argue that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Harsh punishments (long prison sentences) are necessary to deter corruption</li>
          <li>Public officials who betray trust deserve stricter penalties</li>
          <li>The stolen funds should be recovered through asset seizure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Others advocate for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rehabilitation programs focused on ethical training</li>
          <li>Community service as partial restitution</li>
          <li>Systemic reforms rather than just individual punishment</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Discussion Question:</strong> In cases of institutional corruption like this Navy scandal, do you believe the focus should be on severe punishment of individuals or systemic rehabilitation of the institution? What balance would be most effective?</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="media-container">

        <p><em>Image: The balance between punishment and rehabilitation</em></p>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Broader Implications</h3>
      <p>This case highlights ongoing challenges in combating corruption within government institutions worldwide. It also raises questions about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The effectiveness of current anti-corruption measures</li>
        <li>The role of whistleblowers in exposing wrongdoing</li>
        <li>Public trust in military institutions</li>
        <li>The need for transparent procurement systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>As the case develops, it will serve as an important test of Colombia's ability to hold powerful institutions accountable while ensuring due process for all involved.</p>
